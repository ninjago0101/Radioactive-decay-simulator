# Radioactive-decay-simulator

This project simulates radioactive decay using a Monte Carlo approach. It visualizes how a sample of atoms decays over time, following the exponential decay law.
Monte Carlo method simulates randomness by checking if each atom decays at each time step using a probability proportional to the decay constant .
